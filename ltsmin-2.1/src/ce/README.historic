This folder contains all sources for the SCC elimination tool.
Most important files are:

ce.c - main 
paint.h, paint.c - code for coloring reduction
groups.h, groups.c - code for groups reduction



--------------------

The following folders are used for the interaction with PBS:

Scripts	- PBS scripts for calling CE. 
	All 3 (1394.ce, screen1.ce, screen706.ce) are tested
	- in old-scripts: scripts that do not work anymore with 
	the new PBS system
	
Ins	- the input, not reduced, LTSs, in .dir format

Outs	- the LTSs without tau-cycles, in .aut or .dir form
	(default is .aut, there is a switch to .dir in ce.c)

Logs	- the messages generated by CE runs

!! 'Ins' and 'Outs' are symbolic links to directories 
on /data/home/simona/scratch/



--------------------


NOTES:

* the input to CE is in .dir format.
This can be obtained from the output of the instantiator (.dmp), 
using dmp2dir. For instance,

	~bertl/bin/dmp2dir -monitor -nsegments 10 screen.1.dmp

will produce a folder screen.1.dir, with 10 segments.


* 20.10.06: modified Makefile so that it compiles the sources 
for 64-bit computing. I'm not sure whether this has any influence 
on the correctness and performance of CE.


* choosing the method used for SCC reduction (coloring or groups) 
is done not by a command-line option, but by a switch in the beginning of 
ce.c (COLOR)


* screen.706.dir does not reduce properly. 
There's an abnormal termination. See Logs/screen.706-ce.log
Possible causes:
	. an error in the code 
	. the 64-bit processing
	. ?


* for more messages during execution, switch on DEBUG in paint.c
