== NAME

lpo2lts-seq - Sequential state space generator for mCRL models.

== SYNOPSIS

*{manname}* [OPTION]... 'input'_.tbf_ ['output.fmt']

== DESCRIPTION

{manname} generates a labelled transition system from a specification
provided in 'input.tbf' by enumerative reachability analysis using a
general state expanding algorithm. Specifications are in _tbf_ format
and are commonly generated by manpage:mcrl[1] or
manpage:mcrl22mcrl[1].  'output.fmt' specifies the name of
the output archive.  The desired format is deduced from the filename
extension.  Available file formats are described blow.
