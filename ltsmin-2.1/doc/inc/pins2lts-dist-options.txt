*--nice*='LEVEL'::
        Set the nice level of all worker processes. This is useful
        when running on other people's workstations.

*--write-state*::
        Write the full state vector.

*--filter*='<patternlist>'::
        Select the labels to be written to file from the
        state vector elements, state labels and edge labels.
        The argument is a semicolon separated list of shell
        file patterns. Each pattern may be prefixed with "!" to
        exclude a set of labels. If none of the patterns matches the default
        is to exclude the label. Hence, all labels starting with
        an "x" are specified as "x*". The complement all labels,
        except those starting with an "x" are specified as "!x*;*".

*--cost*='<edge label>'::
    The given edge labels defines the cost of an edge. Based on this cost,
    the lowest cost for reaching every state is computed. Moreover, the order
    in which states are explored is such that lower cost states are explored
    before higher costs ones. The levels reported when this options is in effect are
    cost levels. The counter-example traces are guaranteed to be a lowest cost path.
    However, the length of the trace may not be minimal.
