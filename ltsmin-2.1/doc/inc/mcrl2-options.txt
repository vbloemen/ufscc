=== mCRL2 Options


*--mcrl2*='OPTIONS'::
	Pass options to the mCRL2 library.
        Defaults to "+--rewriter=jittyc+".
+
The "+--rewriter=<rewriter>+" option is the only recognized option.
Possible rewriters are +jitty+ and +jittyc+.

*--mcrl2-finite-types*::
	Use mCRL2 finite type information.
+
Enabling this option may cause premature termination in case non-normal-form
instances of finite types occur in the state space. This will be the case,
e.g., when the specification has been pre-processed using
manpage:lpsparunfold[1].

*--mcrl2-readable-edge-labels*::
	Use human readable edge labels.
+
Enabling this option may cause problems during bisimulation reduction, e.g.,
the edge labels l(0) with 0 of type Nat and l(0) with 0 of type Pos will be
mapped to the same string.
