*-n*, *--no-exit*::
      Do not exit when an error is found. Just count errors. Error counts are
      printed with +-v+.


*-d*, *--deadlock*::
      Find state with no outgoing transitions. Returns with exit code 1 if
      a deadlock is found, 0 or 255 (error) otherwise.


*-i*, *--invariant*='PREDFILE|PREDEXPRESSION'::
      Find state where the invariant is violated. The file 'PREDFILE'
      contains an expression in a simple predicate language (see
      manpage:ltsmin-pred[5]). Its contents can also be entered directly as
      a 'PREDEXPRESSION'. Returns with exit code 1 if
      a violation is found, 0 or 255 (error) otherwise.


*-a*, *--action*='STRING'::
      Find state with an outgoing transition of type 'STRING'. Returns with exit
      code 1 if the action is found, 0 or 255 (error) otherwise.


*--trace*='FILE'_.gcf_::
      When finding a deadlock state or a transition labelled with a certain
      action, write a trace to 'FILE'_.gcf_, beginning from the initial state.
      Traces can be pretty-printed with manpage:ltsmin-printtrace[1].
