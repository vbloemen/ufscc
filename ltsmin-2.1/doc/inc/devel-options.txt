*--grey*::
        Make use of +GetTransitionsLong+ calls.
+
A language module can have three next state calls:
+GetTransitionsAll+, +GetTransitionsLong+ and +GetTransitionsShort+. The first call is used by default,
the second call is used when this flag is passed and the third form is used if *--cache* is enabled.
This allows all three calls in a language module to be tested.

*--write-state*::
        Write the full state vector.
