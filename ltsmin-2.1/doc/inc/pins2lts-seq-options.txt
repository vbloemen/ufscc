*--strategy*='TYPE'::
        Select exploration strategy.  'TYPE' can be one of the
        following options:

bfs;;
  explore state space in breadth-first order (default).

dfs;;
  explore state space in depth-first order.

scc;;
  perform LTL model checking based on Buchi automata with Couvreur's
  algorithm (accepting cycle detection).  This requires an accepting
  state label to be present.  See below.

*--state*='TYPE'::
        Select type of data structure for storing visited states.
        'TYPE' can be one of the following options:

tree;;
  use a tree-compressed hash table (default).

table;;
  use a hash table.
 
vset;;
  use a vector set (decision diagram).

*--max*='DEPTH'::
        Maximum search depth, search until 'DEPTH'.


*--proviso*='closedset|stack|color'::
    Change the proviso implementation for partial order reduction (ltl)
+
Change the proviso used to detect that an accepting cycle is closed.
Three options are available, the default is 'closedset'.

closedset;;
    The closed set proviso is the default proviso which requires
    almost no extra work/memory. It might however result in less
    reduction than the 'stack' or 'color' proviso. It works with both
    the dfs- and bfs exploration strategy.

stack;;
    The stack proviso is the proviso used for example by the spin
    model checker. It requires some extra work/memory but may
    result in a better reduction than 'closedset'. It works only
    for a dfs/scc search strategy (since bfs has no stack).

color;;
    The color proviso requires a lot of extra work and memory
    but can significantly improve the reduction. It too works
    only with the dfs/scc search strategies.
