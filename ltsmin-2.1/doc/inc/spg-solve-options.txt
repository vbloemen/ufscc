=== Symbolic Parity Game Solver Options

*--attr*='default'|'chain'|'par'|'par2'::
        Choose attractor function.
+
Available attractor functions:

'default';;
    Straightforward attractor computation. 
'chain';;
    Chaining attractor, applies transition groups in a different order
    than 'default' in computing an attractor level.
'par';;
    Spawns parallel tasks to compute forward and backward steps for each 
    attractor level.
'par2';;
    Spawns more parallel tasks than 'par', by applying forward steps in
    parallel to the result of the backward steps of the different 
    transition groups.
        
*--saturating-attractor*::
        Use saturation in the chaining attractor.
        
*--pg-write-dot*::
        Write dot files to disk during parity game solving for debugging.
