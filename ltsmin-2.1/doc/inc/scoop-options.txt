=== Scoop Options

*--const=<var>=<val>*::
    define constant <var> as <val>

*--max-progress=<actions>*::
    Specify the set of actions for which
    maximal progress has to be enabled. The
    default is 'all', meaning that all
    actions are prioritised. The other
    settings are 'tau', to prioritise just
    the tau steps and 'none' to disable
    maximal progress

*--confluence*::
    Detect confluent summands and write confluent matrix.
    If the backend tool support tau confluence (e.g. pins2lts-dist) then
    this lead to on-the-fly reduction of the state space.
