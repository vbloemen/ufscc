The tool uses http://www.mpi-forum.org/[MPI] for distributed
computation, thus it has to be started via `mpirun`.  _nodespec_
determines which processors the tool is run on.

The workers send messages to themselves. So if you use
http://www.open-mpi.org/[Open MPI], you have to use 
+mpirun -mca btl+ 'CONNECT'+,self+ 'NODESPEC' where
'CONNECT' can be +tcp+, +mx+, +ib+, etc..

//MPI-IO support disabled due to refactoring and bugs.
//
//The tool uses MPI-IO, the I/O chapter in MPI-2, so if your MPI
//implementation has special extensions in MPI-IO, such as
//http://www.pvfs.org/[PVFS2], then those extensions are supported.
