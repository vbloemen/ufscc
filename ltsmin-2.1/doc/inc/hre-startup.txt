=== Hybrid Runtime Options

The Hybrid Runtime Environment provides startup options for several parallel architectures.

==== Posix threads options

If the application supports it and Posix threads are supported by the OS then
the following option is available:

*--threads[='count']*::
Start 'count' worker threads. The default count is the number of CPU's in the system.

==== Posix processes options

If the application supports it and Posix shared memory is supported by the OS then
the following option is available:

*--procs[='count']*::
Fork 'count' worker processes. The default count is the number of CPUs in the system.

Note that MacOS X only supports Posix shared memory from version 10.7 (Lion)
onwards.

==== MPI options

If the application supports it and MPI support was compiled into the binary then
the following options are available:

*--workers='count'*::
Start the program with 'count' MPI workers.

*--mpirun='mpirun arguments'*::
Invoke mpirun with the given arguments.

*--mpi*::
Ignore *--workers* and *--mpirun* options and start the MPI runtime.
