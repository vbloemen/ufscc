== COMPRESSION POLICIES

The grammer for compression policies is:
----
<policy>      ::= ( <pattern> ":" <compression> ";" ) *  <compression>
<pattern>     ::= 'shell wildcard pattern'
<compression> ::= "" | "none" | (<filter> "|") * <filter>
<filter>      ::= "diff32" | ("gzip" [("1"|...|"9")])
----
The list of ++<pattern>":"<compression>++ pairs are rules that specify
specific compression methods for files matching certain patterns. The final
++<compression>++ is the default.

A compression method is built from zero or more filters. The empty sequence can be denoted
with an emtpy string or with the word none. Known compression filters are

++diff32++:: Difference ecoding on 32 bit integers.

++gzip[level]++:: Standard gzip compression with an optional level.


When compressing labeled transition systems that were obtained using BFS exploration order, it is a good idea to
apply difference encoding to state numbers before compression them. This leads to a default compression strategy of
----
src*:diff32|gzip;dest*:diff32|gzip;gzip
----
For the legacy directory format and
----
*ofs:diff32|gzip;gzip
----
For the state label extended directory format.
