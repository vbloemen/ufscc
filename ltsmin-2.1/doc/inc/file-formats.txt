== File Formats

The following file formats are supported:

* Directory format ('{ast}.dir', '{ast}.dz' and '{ast}.gcf')
* Vector format ('{ast}.dir', '{ast}.gcd', '{ast}.gcf')
* Binary Coded Graphs ('{ast}.bcg')
* Aldebaran Format ('{ast}.aut')
* FSM Format ('{ast}.fsm')
* MRMC/Prism ('{ast}.tra'+'{ast}.lab')
* PGSolver format ('{ast}.pg')

If a tool operates in streaming mode then support for file formats is limited,
as can be seen in the following table:

The directory format uses multiple files to store an LTS.
The various extension explain how these files are stored in the underlying file system.
The '{ast}.dir' format uses multiple files in a directory without compression.
If the LTS has one edge label, no state labels and does not store state vectors then
these files are backwards compatible. Neither the '{ast}.dz' nor the '{ast}.gcf'
formats are backwards compatible. Both formats use compression. The first uses a directory for the files,
second interleaves files into a single file.

If you try to open a '{ast}.dir' with the old mCRL tools and
you get the error message:
----
wrong file version: 0
----
then the directory is probably compressed.
If that happens then you may convert the directory by typing the command:
----
ltsmin-convert bad.dir good.dir
----
