== NAME

lps2lts-seq - Sequential state space generator for mCRL2 models.

== SYNOPSIS

*{manname}* [OPTION]... 'input'_.lps_ ['output.fmt']

== DESCRIPTION

{manname} generates a labelled transition system from a specification
provided in 'input.lps' by enumerative reachability analysis using a

and are commonly generated by manpage:mcrl22lps[1].
'output.fmt' specifies the name of
the output archive.  The desired format is deduced from the filename
