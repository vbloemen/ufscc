level[g] = k  <-> the first + on row g is at column k
              <-> event g starts at level k in BDD

back[k] = the index of the last + in any group at level k


Remark: 
- k=0 corresponds to leaves T/F in BDD.
- k=1 corresponds to the rightmost column in the DM (bottom of BDD)
- k=nVars corresponds to the leftmost column in the DM, 
          which is the root of the BDD.

k=0;
Vis={init}
{ invariant: Vis is saturated up to level k }
while (k != nVars) do
  Vis' := Closure (Vis, {g | level[g]=k})
  if Vis=Vis' 
    then k:=k+1
    else k:=back[k]
  Vis:=Vis'
  Vis':=0
