To build SCOOP, you need to have the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (ghc)
and the happy parser generator. We recommend installing the Haskell
Platform, available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. This suffices
to build the library that is used by LTSmin. To build the stand-alone
tool scoop, you'll also need the hashmap package, which is installed
automatically by issuing the commands:

    cabal update
    cabal install hashmap

To configure, build and install the library and tool:

    ./scoopreconf
    ./configure
    make
    make install

Note that when used as an LTSmin submodule, these commands will
be invoked automatically by the LTSmin build system.
